# Crawler
This crawler is based on MediaWiki format wiki-pages

## basic tests
in `cate_test.py`, we can test the categories of certain page.

## page_download
in `page_download.py`, we can download one certain page as xml page.

## download all pages under certain category
in `cate_xml_download.py`, we can do this

## textual
in `xml2txt.py`, we can process xml to pure txt documents. At PRTS, I added some specific processing logic for better document fetching.
